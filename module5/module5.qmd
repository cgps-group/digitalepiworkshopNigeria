# Introduction {#intro}

Data-flo ([https://data-flo.io/](/introduction/readme#what-is-data-flo)) is a system for customised integration and manipulation of diverse data via a simple drag and drop interface.\*\*

For Data-flo documentation, go to <https://docs.data-flo.io/introduction/readme>.

Data-flo can easily combine epidemiological data, genomic data, laboratory data, and various metadata from disparate sources (i.e., different data systems) and formats.

Data-flo provides a visual method to design a reusable pipeline to integrate, clean, and manipulate data in a multitude of ways, eliminating the need for continuous manual intervention (e.g., coding, formatting, spreadsheet formulas, manual copy-pasting).

Data-flo pipelines are combinations of ready-to-use data adaptors that can be tailored, modularised and shared for reuse and reproducibility. Once a Data-flo pipeline has been created, it can be run anytime, by anyone with access, to enable push-button data extraction and transformation. This saves significant time by removing the bulk of the manual repetitive workflows that require multiple sequential or tedious steps, enabling practitioners to focus on analysis and interpretation.

# Objectives {#learning-outcomes}

At the end of this session the participants will be able to:

1.  Build a data transformation dataflow by combining ready-to-use data adaptors suited to the exercise
2.  Acquire a microreact link that combines all the data files from the exercise using data-flo

A cgSNP tree was generated through Pathogenwatch ([`tree.nwk`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8nyAXNaiGIBL-2u30sD-W5Ajy-VNUeR/view?usp=drive_link)). Contextual genomes present in Pathogenwatch (Jan 2020-now) were also included in the tree inference and their associated data added to the [`epi_data.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J9n1bM_527OCWEq6_6XQf7sheE-XL8Ol/view?usp=drive_link) file.

The user now has the information needed for the investigation in the following formats:

-   [`epi_data.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J9n1bM_527OCWEq6_6XQf7sheE-XL8Ol/view?usp=drive_link) Epi data from 3 clinical cases, 7 carriers and 10 environmental samples
-   [`lab_results.xlsx`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ukjQPDBbp9wYKs3mm0U9FRxqOc67Q_Xe/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108741433975672489406&rtpof=true&sd=true) Culture and AST results
-   [`mlst-Pasteur.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dpagR9zHyk1WtJhvfsWqskwZhNc8Enax/view?usp=drive_link) MLST results from Pathogenwatch
-   [`tree.nwk`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R8nyAXNaiGIBL-2u30sD-W5Ajy-VNUeR/view?usp=drive_link) cgSNP tree of 7 Kpn genomes

The files are located in [**this link**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1raGT9V6QrobVJMdBWgwVAQ8zpuIHfjGa?usp=drive_link).

We will combine data from these different sources with a data-flo workflow that takes the files above as input, and creates as an output a Microreact project where the data can be visualised.

Open the data-flo workflow ([**https://data-flo.io/run?wbhznSXSn3qAomUnGrXesx**](https://data-flo.io/run?wbhznSXSn3qAomUnGrXesx))

Copy the workflow to your own dataflo account.

<img src="img/dataflo_copy.png" width="50%" height="50%"/>

This will open a copy of this workflow in your dataflo account.

<img src="img/dataflo_workflow.png" width="50%" height="50%"/>

**On a different browser tab**, get your microreact `API access token` at [**https://microreact.org/my-account/settings**](https://microreact.org/my-account/settings) (you must already have created your microreact account).

<img src="img/miroreact_token.png" width="50%" height="50%"/>

Edit the workflow to include your own microreact `API access token`.

1.  Click on `*access token` in the `Create microreact project` box
2.  From the options on the right, select `Bind to value`
3.  Paste your `API access token` in the `VALUE` box

Save your newly edited dataflo project by clicking on the `save` icon.

Now lets go to the implementation page by clicking on the `i` icon.

To run the workflow upload the files named lab_results.xlsx, tree.nwk, epi_data.csv, and mlst-Pasteur.csv.

Click on **`Run`**. The Outputs box now shows the url of a Microreact project created by data-flo.
