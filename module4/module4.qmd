# Introduction {#intro}

Pathogenwatch provides a platform for analysing and comparing pathogen genome assemblies from around the world, integrating diverse data sets with rich representation. It provides species and taxonomy prediction for over 60,000 variants of bacteria, viruses, and fungi as well as analytical pipelines for a number of pathogens of interest.

# Objectives {#learning-outcomes}

At the end of this session the participants will be able to:

1.  Upload assemblies to PW
2.  Look at QC metrics provided by PW
3.  Create a collection with the uploaded assemblies
4.  Create a collection with the uploaded assemblies plus contextual genomes (`Kp ST258` from Jan 2020 until now)
5.  Explore the genomes in PW
6.  Download the cgSNP tree
7.  Download the Kleborate results
8.  Download the Metadata

# Genome analysis with Pathogenwatch {#analyse-genomes}

`https://pathogen.watch`

After obtaining the high quality assemblies, you will use [**https://pathogen.watch**](https://pathogen.watch) to determine the species and sequence type (ST) of these genomes, understand the wider context and download the results of the analytics.

Click on the upload link at the top right of the home page of Pathogenwatch.

Click on `Single Genome FASTAs` as this is what you have as your output from the assemblies.

Drag and drop your FASTA files into the browser.

You will see the analysis running and the genomes will be speciated and species specific analytics run.

Click on `VIEW GENOMES`.\

Select one of the analysed genomes to look at the single genome report. This is where you can look at results of the analysis, any associated metadata and key stats.

Select `Klebsiella pneumoniae` genomes and click on `Selected Genomes` to create a new collection.

![](img/Pathogenwatch_07_Create_collection.png){fig-align="center"}

Click on `Create Collection` and add a title and description for your initial collection of genomes.

![](img/Pathogenwatch_08_Name_and_Describe_Collection.png){fig-align="center" width="391"}

Click `CREATE NOW` and you can see your initial genomes in the `Collection View`.

![](img/Pathogenwatch_09_Collection.png){fig-align="center"}

Go back to the `Genome View` and now we want to investigate `Kp ST258` and the wider context from 2020 to present day.

You can filter all genomes within Pathogenwatch from the left sidebar.

Filter the genomes by:

-   Genus - `Klebsiella`

-   Species - `Klebsiella pneumoniae`

-   MLST - `ST 258`

-   Date - `2020 to 2023`

![](img/Pathogenwatch_11_Filter_parameters.png){fig-align="center" width="339"}

You will see all genomes that are publicly available for those filters that you have applied.

Create a collection with all the genomes that are listed.

![](img/Pathogenwatch_12_wider_collection_description.png){fig-align="center" width="430"}

Explore this wider collection in the `Collection View`.

![](img/Pathogenwatch_13_wider_collection_view.png){fig-align="center"}

You can now download the results as files. Download the `Metadata table`, `Kleborate results` and the `Tree` as a `.nwk` file.

You should now be able to find the following files in your `Downloads` folder:

[metadata.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hsJFZjzaWFUWeRhkU8H7rfnabcyxDCRR/view?usp=drive_link)

[kleborate.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qC32dWw3ClUdFpK0LsTn3-nBazXxtpul/view?usp=drive_link)

[tree.nwk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4KnpHY6rVKV6spwy9bBMeV3wnHwuJoj/view?usp=drive_link)
